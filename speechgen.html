						<section style="line-height: 1.75em; font-size: 22px">
							<p>
								Large language models (LLMs) have gained considerable attention for Artificial
								Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), particularly with the emergence of ChatGPT.
								However, the direct adaptation of continuous speech to LLMs that process discrete tokens
								remains an unsolved challenge, hindering the application of LLMs for speech generation.
								The advanced speech LMs are in the corner, as that speech signals encapsulate a wealth
								of information, including speaker and emotion, beyond textual data alone. Prompt tuning
								has demonstrated notable gains in parameter efficiency and competitive performance on
								some speech classification tasks. However, the extent to which prompts can effectively
								elicit generation tasks from speech LMs remains an open question. In this paper, we
								present pioneering research that explores the application of prompt tuning to stimulate
								speech LMs for various generation tasks, within a unified framework called SpeechGen,
								with around 10M trainable parameters. The proposed unified framework holds great promise
								for efficiency and effectiveness, particularly with the imminent arrival of advanced
								speech LMs, which will significantly enhance the capabilities of the framework.
